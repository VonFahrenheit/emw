To edit one of these files:
	- edit the .png, but make sure you don't change the size of the file
	- port the file with SNESGFX
		- format has to 4bpp packed or 2bpp packed or 8bpp linear
		- check "accurate conversion", "arrange colors: settings -> manually" and "handle transparency"
		- uncheck everything else
		- when porting, make sure your manually picked palette has the colors in the exact same order as the palette the GFX is meant to be used with (compare with YY-CHR or Lunar Magic window when porting)
	- save the generated .bin in the appropriate location
