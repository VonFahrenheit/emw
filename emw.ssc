00	0020	A simple sprite that follows players. It can climb walls and ceilings and jump over small gaps. It tries to jump over players if it gets close (meaning they usually won't get hit if they stand still). If the slime takes damage, it turns red and moves faster. While red, it tries to jump on the player rather than over.\n\nHP: 2\nRank: D\nTraits: None\nType: Dynamic (1 tile)\nExtra bit: Yes
00	0022	0,16,*Happy\nSlime* 0,0,420
00	0030	With the extra bit set, the Happy Slime is stationary. If another sprite is placed on top of it, it will bounce it straight up, then catch it and repeat. The extra bit is cleared if the slime takes damage.\n\nHP: 2\nRank: D\nTraits: None\nType: Dynamic (1 tile)\nExtra bit: Yes

01	0020	This version of the Goomba walks straight ahead, turning at walls but walking off ledges. If another sprite is placed on top of it, the slave will carry it. Placing several Goomba Slaves on top of each other will form a totem (note that they should be Z-ordered so that you see the X of only the top sprite). Use with extra bit version to allow totems to carry players.\n\nHP: 1\nRank: E\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (6 tiles for Goomba, 4 tiles for tray)\nExtra bit: Yes
01	0022	0,16,*Goomba\nSlave* 0,0,420
01	0030	With the extra bit set, the Goomba Slave spawns with a tray on its head. The tray can be jumped on to reveal a mushroom, which can then be collected as a normal powerup. The Goomba maintains its empty tray afterward, which can be used as a platform. If the Goomba is placed on the top of a totem, it spawns with an empty tray meant to be used as a platform.\n\nHP: 1\nRank: E\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (6 tiles for Goomba, 4 tiles for tray)\nExtra bit: Yes

02	0020	Rex, EMW version. This one is a lot more complex under the hood, though that is normally not apparent. Turns around at ledges rather than walking off.\nExtra byte 1 gives the Rex a bag.\n01 - sack that drops coins\n02 - bindle with a mushroom\n03 - backpack (??)\n04 - box (??)\n05 - sword (this lets the rex chase players on sight, similar to aggro rex)\nFF - turns the rex into a golden bandit which drops a yoshi coin upon being hit (yoshi coin ID is determined by extra byte 2)\nExtra byte 2 gives the Rex a hat.\n01 - green robin hood hat\n02 - red hat with bow\n03 - straw hat\n04 - red fez-like hat\n05 - bandit bandana (this one increases the values of coins dropped by the sack)\n06 - top hat and mustache\n07 - bandana\n08 - knight helmet\n\nHP: 2\nRank: E\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (1.75-4.00 KB)\nExtra bit: Yes

02	0032	0,16,*Rex\nstationary* 0,0,420

03	0020	This Rex will walk, then stop to throw a hammer. The hammer is quite accurate and usually hits stationary players. The sprite always turns to face a player upon throwing a hammer. The sprite loses its ability to throw hammers upon taking damage.\n\nHP: 2\nRank: D\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (3KB)\nExtra bit: Yes
03	0022	0,16,*Hammer\nRex* 0,0,420
03	0030	With the extra bit set, the Hammer Rex will not move. Instead, it stands its ground and throws hammers. Upon taking damage it will start moving as usual.\n\nHP: 2\nRank: D\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (3KB)\nExtra bit: Yes
03	0032	0,16,*Hammer Rex\nstaionary* 0,0,420

04	0020	This powerful enemy will give relentless pursuit upon spotting a player. The Aggro Rex climbs walls and jumps over pits to reach its target. If the target is below the Aggro Rex, it will drop down ledges instead of jumping (meaning that it won't get stuck if you hide in a pit). The Aggro Rex can also jump off of a wall that it is climbing to reach its target.\n\nHP: 3\nRank: C\nTraits: Fireproof, Durable, Uncrushable (NORMAL and up)\nType: Dynamic (4 tiles)\nExtra bit: Yes
04	0022	0,16,*Aggro\nRex* 0,0,420

05	0020	The Conjurex walks forward, then stops to fire a projectile. It always faces a player upon casting its spell. Also turns at walls and ledges. It will move faster upon taking damge but will not shrink, meaning that it can still cast its spells.\n\nHP: 2\nRank: D\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (3KB)\nExtra bit: Yes
05	0022	0,16,*Conjurex* 0,0,420
05	0030	With the extra bit set, the Conjurex will not move from its spot. Instead, it holds its ground and casts its spells from there. Since the Shaman drops its mask instead of shrinking upon taking damage, it will not start moving but keep casting spells.\n\nHP: 2\nRank: D\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (3KB)\nExtra bit: Yes
05	0032	0,16,*Conjurex\nstationary* 0,0,420

06	0020	The Wizrex is an extremely deadly enemy. It will stay out of range of most player attacks while preparing its own. It can fire projectils in a spray pattern or a circle pattern. It can also swoop along the ground, quickly jumping up and firing projectiles upon getting close to a player. The amount of projectiles it fires with all of its attacks depends on difficulty.\n\nHP: 4\nRank: A\nTraits: Fireproof, Durable\nType: Dynamic (6 tiles)\nExtra bit: Yes
06	0022	0,16,*Wizrex* 0,0,420
06	0030	Master Shaman's Mask. It behaves similarly to the Wizrex. However, it is invulnerable and has no body hitbox/hurtbox. It is meant to chase players like a Phanto.\n\nHP: Invulnerable\nRank: A\nTraits: None\nType: Dynamic (8 tiles) 3D Cluster (5 joints)\nExtra bit: Yes.

09	0020	This sprite controls a large amount of space and is more of an obstacle than a threat. It walks back and forth, turning around at walls and ledges. Upon spotting a player, it will attempt to either grab or punch them by stretching out its arm. If it grabs a player, it throws them towards the latest ledge it turned around at. The Tar Creeper blocks against all attacks by using its two hands, and it can not be passed through. Jumping on the Tar Creeper causes it to carry the player with it. The Tar Creeper deals no contact damage unless it is using its punch. The only way to kill one is to use fire.\n\nHP: Invulnerable (but dies instantly to fire)\nRank: D\nTraits: None\nType: Dynamic (6 tiles) + Pseudo-dynamic (4KB)

0B	0020	The Mole Wizard is an obnoxious enemy that is difficult to kill. It deals no damage. It moves around by burrowing through the ground, then fires Mini Moles toward a player. The Mini Moles will latch onto players they touch, disrupting their controls until they mash out. Jumping on the Mole Wizard causes it to instantly burrow without taking damage, but other attacks will hurt it.\n\nHP: 2/2/4\nRank: F\nTraits: Fireproof, Durable\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (2KB)\nExtra bit: No
0B	0022	0,16,*Mole Wizard* 0,0,420

0C	0020	This sprite is more fun than dangerous. The Mini Mole walks forward, turning at walls but walking off ledges. If it touches a player, it latches onto them and disrupts their controls by pushing random buttons until the player mashes out. The Mini Mole dies when the player mashes out, but it is otherwise invulnerable.\n\nHP: Invulnerable\nRank: F\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (4 8x8 tiles)\nExtra bit: Yes
0C	0022	0,16,*Mini\nMole* 0,0,420
0C	0030	Setting the extra bit causes the Mini Mole to spawn burrowed, much like a normal Mony Mole. It should be placed inside a block in this state. The Mini Mole does break the block it comes out of.\n\nHP: Invulnerable\nRank: F\nTraits: None\nType: Pseudo-dynamic (4 8x8 tiles)\nExtra bit: Yes

0D	0020	This Plant Head rotates to face players as best it can, hurting them upon contact. If the Plant Head is placed on a destructible vine tile, its range of motion is restricted to within 60 degrees of the vine. If the Plant Head dies, its vine starts disintegrating (if it is placed on one). Any attack will kill the Plant Head, but it can not be jumped on.\n\nHP: 1\nRank: E\nTraits: None\nType: Super-dynamic (size not yet calculated)\nExtra bit: Yes

0F	0020	This is a solid 16x16 block. Since it is a sprite, it can be placed overlapping layer 1 tiles. This counts as solid for other sprites as well as players. Extra byte 1 can toggle interactions, but only if extra bit is off.\n1 = disable sprite interaction\n2 = disable sprite interaction\n3 = disable all interaction\n\nHP: Invulnerable\nRank: N/A\nTraits: None\nType: Basic\nExtra bit: Yes
