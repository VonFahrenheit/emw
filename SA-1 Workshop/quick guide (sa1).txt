This is a quick guide to you get working fast with the SA-1 Pack. It's pretty simple really, but the readme may be a little confusing at start, so I created this file specially for who is starting to work with SA-1 Pack.

Requirements:
	- Asar 1.31 or newer; and
	- Lunar Magic 2.20 or newer.

Guide:
	1. Grab a CLEAN UNMODIFIED ROM. If your ROM is not clean, there's a 99.99% chance that this guide will fail.
	2. Open your ROM with Lunar Magic and go to File -> Expand ROM -> Expand ROM to 2MB and confirm.
	3. Place asar.exe and your ROM on same folder as you extracted SA-1 Pack.
	4. Double click asar.exe
	5. Type sa1.asm on "Enter patch name" and press enter.
	6. Type your ROM name on "Enter ROM name" and press enter. Your ROM should be patched with SA-1.
	7. Open your ROM with Lunar Magic and save any level.

That's all. Your ROM should be ready to be on "SA-1 adventure"!
If you want to use any external tool, sprite, block or patch, please check them on these links, since they contains SA-1 compatible resources. All original resources won't work, so you must use these links unless if the author stated that the resource works with SA-1.

Compatible Tools: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16203903/A/SA1/ctools.html
Compatible Patches: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16203903/A/SA1/cpatches.html
Compatible Blocks: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16203903/A/SA1/cblocks.html
Compatible Sprites: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16203903/A/SA1/csprites.html

Most of the Sprites and Blocks however can be converted automatically with a tool called "SA-1 Convert". Please take a look in the Tools Section on SMW Central if you're interested.
Also any resource on SMW Central with "sa-1" tag also should work with SA-1 ROMs, including Patches.

Also some tools on page can have a function to automatically convert any incompatible resource to SA-1 format, so you can use them if you don't have alternative.

You don't need to worry about music (.txt/.bnk/.brr) files, they will work with SA-1 normally. The only thing you have to worry is if the tool to insert them (Addmusic) is compatible.

AddmusicK works natively with SA-1, so if you're using it, you don't have to worry about music.
