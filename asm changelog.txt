

	2019-06-17:
		- improved PCE physics engine (added a shared function for acceleration)
		- added ice physics for Kadaal and Leeway
		- added Happy Slime (custom sprite 0x00) option by setting the extra bit:
			- in this mode it will be stationary and bounce objects on its head
			- if it is damaged, it will turn red and chase the player like normal
			- it can bounce almost any sprite that it touches
			- you can even have chains of this sprite on top of each other
		- improved Happy Slime physics and AI:
			- it no longer clips into the floor
			- it will try to jump over players when green and on top of them when red
		- inserted Lava Lord boss as custom sprite 0x20
		- implemented 3D tilemap system (I call it the 3D Joint Cluster System)
			- this can process 3D models, which are made up by joints
			- each joint is attached to another one in a position defined by distance and 2 angles
			- each cluster has a core which is only attached to itself
			- rotating the core will rotate the entire object
			- when a cluster is processed it is converted to a tilemap that can be loaded by a sprite
			- 3D clusters can be used to achieve very smooth animations
			- this system is extremely demanding and can lag even the SA-1 if models are made too complex
		- inserted Coin Golem as custom sprite 0x21
			- Coin Golem makes use of 3D tilemaps
			- it uses standard palettes but requires Sprite Yoshi Coin to be added to the level's GFX index


	2019-06-23:
		- Coin Golem:
			- moved head 11.25 degrees forward
			- added run animation
			- added turn animation
		- inserted sprite Yoshi Coin as custom sprite 0x22
			- works as normal Yoshi Coin but it is a sprite
			- it has level GFX index support so it is easy to use
			- it should not be placed in Lunar Magic as that will let it respawn
			- this can be spawned from blocks or from other sprites, which is its intended use

			- limbs behindd the body will now be darker to show depth

			- coin golem can be killed by hitting its torso or head or jumping on its head enough times
			- coin golem will drop its head as a Yoshi Coin upon death
		- Alter (0.1):
			- Alter added in slot 4 in PCE
			- Alter does not yet have any GFX but has some basic movement ready for testing
		- Leeway (2.2):
			- increased the height of the air slash hitbox
			- landing with an air slash should now hit short grounded enemies 100% of the time

			- added activation animation
